## About ‚ÑπÔ∏è

**`Memory Card`** is a _memory-card-game_ implemented in `ReactJS`. While creating this project, I have learned how to use `UseState` and `UseEffect` hooks in ReactJS. The game should have a grid of cards with different images on each card. When the user clicks on a card, the grid shuffles and user again clicks on another card. If the two cards match, the player loses. If the two cards don't match, the player wins. The game ends when all the cards are clicked without any matches. The player can restart the game at any time.
